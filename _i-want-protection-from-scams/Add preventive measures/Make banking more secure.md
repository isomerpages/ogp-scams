<h3><strong>Banking Safe</strong></h3>
<p>ScamShield App and security features (e.g. enable Two-Factor Authentication
(2FA), Multifactor Authentication for banks and set up transaction limits
for internet banking transactions, including PayNow).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refrain from giving out personal information and bank details, whether
on a website or to callers over the phone. Personal information and bank
details such as internet bank account usernames, passwords, OTP codes from
tokens, are useful to criminals.</p>
<h3><strong>Money Lock</strong></h3>
<p>Money Lock secures a portion of your bank savings to further protect it
against scams. Speak to your bank for more information.</p>
