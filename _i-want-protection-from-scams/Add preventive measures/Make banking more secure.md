<h3><strong>Banking Safe</strong></h3>
<p>ADD - ScamShield App and security features (e.g. enable Two-Factor Authentication
(2FA), Multifactor Authentication for banks and set up transaction limits
for internet banking transactions, including PayNow).&nbsp;</p>
<p>CHECK - For scam signs with official sources (e.g. ScamShield WhatsApp
bot @ <a href="https://go.gov.sg/scamshield-bot" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/scamshield-bot</a>,
call the Anti-Scam Helpline on 1800-722-6688, or visit <a href="http://www.scamalert.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.scamalert.sg</a>).
Refrain from giving out personal information and bank details, whether
on a website or to callers over the phone. Personal information and bank
details such as internet bank account usernames, passwords, OTP codes from
tokens, are useful to criminals.</p>
<p>TELL - Authorities, family, and friends about scams and do not be pressured
by the caller to act impulsively. Report the number to WhatsApp and Telegram
to initiate in-app blocking and report any fraudulent transactions to your
bank immediately.</p>
