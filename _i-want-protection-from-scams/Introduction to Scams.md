<h2><strong>What is a scam?</strong></h2>
<p>Not all negative experiences are scams. A scam is designed to trick you
into giving away your money, personal details or data by offering an attractive
deal or false information.</p>

<p>Perpetrators would establish links with potential victims via various
communication channels, such as via phone calls, WhatsApp messages, SMSes,
social media and e-commerce platforms;</p>
</li>

<p>Perpetrators would target victims who unwittingly respond to their outreach
and deceive the victims, resulting in victims losing something of value
to the perpetrators (usually transferring of money or virtual credits,
or revealing personal particulars or credentials)</p>

victims throughout the entire engagement process.</p>
