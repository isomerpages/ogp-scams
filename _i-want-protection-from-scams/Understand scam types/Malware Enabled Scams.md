<h2><strong>Malware-enabled Scams</strong></h2>
<p>Victims generally responded to advertisements for services (e.g. home
cleaning, food purchase and pet grooming) on social media platforms such
as Facebook and Instagram. Under the pretext of payment for the services,
the scammers would send victims a file or URL link over WhatsApp, requiring
them to download an Android Package Kit (APK) file, an app created for
the Android operating system. These APK files contained malware which targeted
the victims’ devices. After the victims downloaded the APK file, the scammers
might instruct the victims to make payment by providing their banking credentials
and/or card details in spoofed websites which resembled banks’ login sites.
The malware might also grant scammers remote access to the victims’ devices.
This would allow scammers to obtain the victims’ banking credentials and/or
card details by keylogging or monitoring the victims’ usage of their devices.
Subsequently, the victims would realise that they had been scammed when
they discovered unauthorised transactions on their bank accounts or debit/credit
cards.</p>
