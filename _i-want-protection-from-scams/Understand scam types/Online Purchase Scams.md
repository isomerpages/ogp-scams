<h2><strong>Online Purchase Scam</strong></h2>
<p>An unusually good deal for a gadget, amusement park or concert tickets
attracts your attention online. You transfer payment to the "seller" who
promises delivery of the item. In some cases, the seller demands further
payment for duties or delivery charges after the first payment is made.
Ultimately, you never receive the item.  In another variant, you may be
asked to pay in cash for items that you did not purchase, that are different
to what you thought you purchased or are cheap replicas.  Many of these
fake sellers may pose as legitimate online sellers on popular marketplaces,
create fake websites, or even place advertisements on social media to build
credibility.  You only realise you've been scammed after paying for the
items in cash.</p>
