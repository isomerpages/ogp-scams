officials, create a sense of urgency, or offer enticing deals to manipulate
individuals into falling victim to their schemes.</p>
<p>They usually lead to various detrimental outcomes, including financial
loss, identity theft, unauthorized access to personal accounts, and compromise
of sensitive information.</p>
<p>Protect yourself from the scam calls and SMSes by taking the following
actions.</p>
<h1><strong>ScamShield App</strong></h1>

on-device algorithm scans SMSes from unsaved contact to detect scam SMSes.</p>
