### Immediate Actions

2. Turn your phone to “flight mode”.  
3. Check that Wi-Fi is switched off and do not switch it on.  
4. Run an anti-virus scan on your phone.  
5. Check your bank account/Singpass/CPF etc for any unauthorised transaction(s) using other device(s).  
6. If there are unauthorised transaction(s), report to the bank, relevant authorities, and lodge a Police report.  
7. After completing steps 1-6, if you believe that your phone has not been infected with malware, you may resume usage of your phone. As a further precaution, you may consider doing a “factory reset” of your phone and changing important passwords.
