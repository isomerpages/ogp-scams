<p>MOS Sun Xueling launched the “I can ACT against scams” national anti-scam
campaign during the “SCAMINAR! ACT Against Scams” on 18 January 2023. The
national campaign aims to educate and encourage members of the public to
translate scam awareness into action by proactively adopting anti-scam
measures. ACT outlines three actions that individuals should proactively
take to safeguard themselves and our community against scams by “Adding”
security features; “Checking” for scam signs and verifying with official
sources; and “Telling” authorities, family and friends about scams.</p>
